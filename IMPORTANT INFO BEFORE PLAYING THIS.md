# To-the-Earth-core
A modpack for Minecraft that work with Cubic Chunk. You can dig down all the way to the Earth core!
First, you need to install Cubic Chunk 904 and Cubic World Gen 34. 

here the link: https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/2792887-cubic-chunks-mod-almost-infinite-world-height-and

You also need the dependencies for Cubic Chunk.

Second, copy my preset "ToTheEarthCore". When you create a new world, go to more world options, change world type: Default to: Custom Cubic.
Then click customize, then click preset. Delete everything and copy paste my preset in the big box. Click done, and done again. Then you can create the world.

IMPORTANT: This mod need the preset, else you will just play in a normal vanilla game. My ores only generate using the preset.

For now, the preset is NOT going to the Earth core. I am planning to create many preset version. 
The one right now is more for a cool gaming experience. 
I will eventually create a more extreme version that allow you to dig up to 100,000 cubes deep, and another version that is Realistic.

NOTE: You recommand to download Vertical Spawn Control mod [by Foghrye4]. Then you can take the vertical_spawn_control.json I have and place it in the data folder of your world, create a new folder named vertical_spawn_control folder and place the json there.

NOTE: My mod replace all vanilla tools and armor from the game so to avoid any mobs or chest from giving vanilla tools and armor, place my loot_tables folder inside the data folder of your world.
